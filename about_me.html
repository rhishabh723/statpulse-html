            A LITTLE ABOUT ME
          </h1>
          <p>
            I'm Rhishabh, a passionate sports fan who loves to work with sports data. I completed my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering and then pursued my Masters from Duke University in 2019. I have been in the Analytics field for about 5 years at this point,
             and would love to carve out a role within the league/team levels using the skills acquired. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Storytelling and visualization is a skill that is crucial in any industry, and I hope this work does justice to provide successful data insights. Analyzing analytics in sports started as a hobby in 2020, and it turned out to be a much bigger endeavour over time for me. 
            Being able to deliver sound sports analysis in the simplest way to consume by fans, stands as the biggest motivation behind this project. My analytical work uses Python, SQL and Machine Learning Models to build these views out.
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently I focus on NBA Basketball and Formula One racing data, mainly because API's are easily available for these sports and I have pipelines established to scrape this information. Most of the work I do is during my off-time and
            after my work. I love working in my free time to identify and develop new ways of processing sports data, that gives us that helps us understand what makes teams and players so good at their craft.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the past I have worked as an Intern at Wasserman, and currently work as the Manager of Business Intelligence and Analytics at CBS Sports. I would appreciate any feedback or insights that you would like to share with me. 
            Please feel free to reach out to me at rhishabh23@gmail.com and I'd be happy to get back to you. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Thanks for taking the time to go over my site, and I look forward to connecting with fellow sports enthusiasts.
